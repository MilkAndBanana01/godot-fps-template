# godot-fps-template
A free and open source FPS template for GODOT.

This is a free first person game template for the Godot Engine. It contains a fully customizable player move set, working settings and UI, keybinding functionality and basic elements such as doors, levers, buttons, etc.

This project can also be downloaded as a Godot project file, where you can dive into the code, with fully commented lines for easy learning of how every bit and piece works in the game.

This is also completely free! Feel free to use the assets, code, and sound effects used in this game (special thanks to Kenney for the assets) for your own and get started with working on your FPS game in Godot!
